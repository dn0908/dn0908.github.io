## Intern at Hyundai Motors Group Headquarters
### ã…¤
In the summer of 2022, I worked at the Hyundai Motors Group Headquarters located in Yangjae, Seoul as a Student Intern. I mainly provided support for technology development, startup research, and patent assetization in the robot division of smart factory planning team.

During my internship, I developed robot software architecture for the smart factory in Singapore (HMGICS, Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre) and performed various research on robot automation in smart factories. I also was in charge of reviewing the robotics startup contest (2022 HMG ZER01NE Accelerator Program) and distributed in-depth weekly reports about innovation and technology trends in the team. Furthermore, I managed document and meeting translations for international advisory groups.

I was able to work with Boston Dynamics' Spot robot and had various experience inside and outside the company!
