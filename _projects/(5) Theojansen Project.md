## Autonomous Legged Robot using Theo Jansen Linkage
### ㅤ

As a part of a robot project during my undergraduate course, I made a Theo Jansen linkage-based legged robot and participated in a self-driving challenge. I designed the linkage using simulation, fabricated the robot by myself and programmed the software for the challenge.

### 1. Simulation and Modeling of Jansen Mechanism

Using V-REP Simulation, I modelled different types of linkage that can be used for a legged robot and did parameter studies in different leg, motor and frame properties.

I found the possible best case of parameters and designed the leg mechanism according to it. And using carbon rods for the legs axes and FDM printed parts, I assembled the robot.

### 2. Self-Driving Algorithm using Lane and Obstacle detection
Using the legged robot, I designed Self-Driving Algorithm using Lane and Obstacle detection using Python OpenCV and Cascade Classifier.
