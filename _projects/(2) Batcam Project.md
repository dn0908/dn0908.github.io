## Vision-Ultrasound Robotic System based on Deep Learning for Gas and Arc Hazard Detection in Manufacturing
### ã…¤
During my undergraduate research in the Soft Computing Lab, Yonsei University, I developed a deep learning-based robotic system to detect and classify anomaly in manufacturing environment.

The robot system mimics the human visual-acoustic reasoning process while extending its perceptual range through directional ultrasonic sensing.
