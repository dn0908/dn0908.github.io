We  proposed  an  unmanned  water  rescue  robot  with  self-inflating  life  jacket  launching mechanism and emergency detection for efficient rescue operations near rivers and lakes.

Existing rescue devices are difficult to use and requires manual operation. The presented robot integrates an IR camera, a LiDAR, and an object detection machine learning model for effective detection in night and unpopulated environments. Moreover, the system features vertical and horizontal rotation and a pitching machine mechanism that enable precise detection and automatic launching. This system is expected to overcome the limitations of conventional systems and enhance the efficiency of water rescue operatons. You can see the working video of the system in youtube!
