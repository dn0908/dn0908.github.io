In-vehicle noise classification plays a crucial role in ensuring driver and passenger safety and comfort, providing valuable insights into vehicle performance and condition. Continual data collection by automotive manufacturers necessitates a more efficient approach to adapt the models to emerging noise classes without sacrificing performance. To address this challenge, we propose dynamic prototype-guided episodic memory (DPEM), a novel method that focuses on selectively storing representative samples in episodic memory. DPEM leverages clustering analysis and prototype computation to dynamically optimize the number of prototypes, enhancing memory efficiency. We extensively evaluate DPEM on real-world in-vehicle noise datasets collected from a global automobile manufacturer within a class-incremental learning pipeline. The experimental results demonstrate that DPEM achieves high classification performance (6.38%p improvement) in class-incremental condition, showcasing its potential in continual learning applications for automotive environments.
